## Hey, I’m Matt 👋

I run [Close Quarters Consulting](https://closequartersconsulting.com), where I help e-commerce businesses create operational clarity and real ROI by tightening workflows and automating the repetitive work.

### What I’m focused on 🎯
- 🧭 **Ops clarity:** turning “tribal knowledge” into documented, repeatable systems  
- 🏗️ **Leverage without complexity:** my specialty is small teams that need leverage, not complexity  
- 🤖 **Automation with ROI:** customer service workflows, reporting, fulfillment handoffs, and internal ops  
- 📈 **Marketing that compounds:** SEO + paid search built on a fast, conversion-friendly site foundation  

### What you’ll find in my GitHub 🧰
Practical utilities I build to support real client work—scripts, workflow helpers, and templates that make systems easier to run, maintain, and scale.

### Tools I use ⚙️
- 🔁 **Automation:** n8n, Airtable, Notion, Zapier/Make, Google Workspace  
- 🧠 **AI:** Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini/OpenRouter, prompt systems, knowledge bases, structured outputs  
- 🛒 **Web:** Shopify, WordPress, Python + JavaScript
